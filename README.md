# Chordify

Chordify is a peer-to-peer (P2P) music sharing application built on top of the Chord Distributed Hash Table (DHT) protocol. In this project, nodes share song metadata (with the song title as the key and a string representing the node's address as the value). The system supports dynamic node joining and graceful departures, data replication across multiple nodes, and two consistency modesâ€”linearizability and eventual consistency.

This project was developed as part of the Distributed Systems course at the National Technical University of Athens (NTUA) for the 2024-2025 academic year.

## Introduction

Chordify implements a simplified version of the Chord DHT protocol. Each node is responsible for a range of keys derived from applying the SHA1 hash on the combination `ip_address:port`. The basic operations include:

- **insert(key, value):** Adds a new song or updates an existing one (by concatenating values).
- **query(key):** Retrieves the value associated with a key; using `"*"` returns all key-value pairs across the DHT.
- **delete(key):** Removes the key-value pair from the network.
- **depart:** Allows a node to gracefully exit, updating its neighbors.
- **overlay:** Displays the current network topology.

The system supports data replication (with a configurable replication factor) and offers both linearizability (using quorum or chain replication) and eventual consistency options.

## Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)


---

## Docker Setup
### Creating the Network
Create a Docker network for the Chordify application:

```bash
docker network create chord-network
```
### Running the Bootstrap Node
Start the bootstrap node (the first, stable node in the system) with:
```bash
docker run --name bootstrap --network chord-network --env-file .env -p 8000:8000 --rm chordify python bootstrap.py
```
---

### Basic API Interactions
After starting the bootstrap node, you can interact with the API:

Update replication and consistency settings:
```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"replication_factor": 3, "consistency_mode": "eventual"}' \
     http://127.0.0.1:8000/update_settings
```
Insert a song:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8001/insert \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"key": "song1", "value": "node8001"}'
```
Query a song:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://127.0.0.1:8001/query?key=song1"
```
---

## Linux Commands
### For users running on Windows, PowerShell commands replace the typical curl syntax:

Insert a song:
```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8001/insert" `
  -Method Post `
  -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
  -Body '{"key": "song1", "value": "Imagine"}'
```
Query a song:

```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8001/query?key=song1" -Method Get
```
Delete a song:

```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8001/delete" `
  -Method Post `
  -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
  -Body '{"key": "song1"}'
```
Display network overlay:

```bash
(Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8001/overlay" -Method GET).Content
```
Depart from the network:

```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:8001/depart -Method POST
```
---
## Windows Commands

Insert a song:
```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8001/insert" `
  -Method Post `
  -Headers @{ "Content-Type" = "application/json" } `
  -Body '{"key": "song1", "value": "Imagine"}'
```
Query a song:

```bash
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://127.0.0.1:8001/query?key=song1" -Method Get
```
Delete a song:

```

## Docker Compose
### To build and run the entire system using Docker Compose, use the following commands:
```bash
sudo docker-compose build
sudo docker-compose up
```
---
## Adding New Nodes
### You can add new nodes to the network using the following commands (example for node5 and node6):

adding Node5 :

```bash
sudo docker run -d \
    --network chordify_default \
    --name node5 \
    -v $(pwd):/app \
    -e IP=node5 \
    -e PORT=8005 \
    -p 8005:8005 \
    chordify \
    python app.py --ip node5 --port 8005 --bootstrap_ip bootstrap --bootstrap_port 8000
```
Adding Node6 :
```bash
sudo docker run -d \
    --network chordify_default \
    --name node6 \
    -v $(pwd):/app \
    -e IP=node6 \
    -e PORT=8006 \
    -p 8006:8006 \
    chordify \
    python app.py --ip node6 --port 8006 --bootstrap_ip bootstrap --bootstrap_port 8000
```

## Additional Commands
Get network overlay:

```bash

curl -X GET http://10.0.62.183:8001/overlay
```

Get node information:

```bash

curl -X GET http://10.0.62.183:8001/nodeinfo
```

Query all keys in the DHT:
```bash
curl -X GET "http://10.0.62.183:8001/query?key=*"
```
---

## Experiments 
For performance evaluation, the following experiments are conducted:

Write Throughput:
Insert all keys from the 10 different insert_n.txt files concurrently (using various replication factors: k=1, k=3, k=5) and under both linearizability and eventual consistency modes. The experiment measures how throughput changes with increasing replication factors.

Read Throughput:
Query all keys from the 10 different query_n.txt files concurrently, measuring the read throughput under each setup and comparing the effect of different replication factors.

Mixed Workload Testing:
Run a set of mixed requests from the requests_n.txt files and record query responses under both consistency models. The goal is to determine which consistency mode delivers fresher values.

Results and analysis of these experiments should be documented in a separate report (PDF) along with the source code submission.

## Conclusion

Chordify provides a robust implementation of a Chord-based DHT for a music sharing application. With support for replication and configurable consistency models, it serves as a practical implementation of key concepts in distributed systems such as node management, data distribution, and fault tolerance. This project also lays the groundwork for further enhancements such as improved routing (e.g., implementing finger tables) and dynamic scaling.
